*/sample1497 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS GOING TOWARDS MY BOAT I
*/sample1498 WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE FOOTPRINT OF A MAN ON
*/sample1499 THE SAND I STOOD AMAZED I LISTENED I LOOKED AROUND
*/sample1500 ME I COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR SEE ANYTHING I WENT
*/sample1501 UP HIGHER TO LOOK DOWN I WENT UP THE SHORE
*/sample1502 AND DOWN THE SHORE BUT IT WAS NO GOOD I
*/sample1503 COULD FIND NO OTHER FOOT PRINT BUT THAT ONE I
*/sample1504 WENT TO SEE IT AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE WERE
*/sample1505 ANY MORE FOOT PRINTS AND TO TELL IF IT WERE
*/sample1506 MY IMAGINATION BUT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN FOR THERE WAS
*/sample1507 EXACTLY THE PRINT OF A FOOT I COULD NOT IMAGINE
*/sample1508 HOW IT CAME THERE I STAYED A LONG TIME THINKING
*/sample1509 BUT BECAME MORE AND MORE CONFUSED AT LAST I RETURNED
*/sample1510 HOME VERY FRIGHTENED LOOKING BEHIND ME AFTER EVERY TWO OR
*/sample1511 THREE STEPS MISTAKING EVERY BUSH AND TREE TO BE A
*/sample1512 MAN WHEN I CAME TO MY CAVE WHICH I CALLED
*/sample1513 MY CASTLE I RAN INSIDE IT AS IF I WERE
*/sample1514 BEING CHASED I DO NOT REMEMBER WHETHER I USED THE
*/sample1515 LADDER OR WENT IN BY THE HOLE IN THE ROCK
*/sample1516 WHICH I CALLED THE DOOR I RAN FOR COVER FASTER
*/sample1517 THAN ANY ANIMAL COULD RUN I DID NOT SLEEP THAT
*/sample1518 NIGHT THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN
*/sample1519 THE MORE AFRAID I BECAME I THOUGHT IT COULD BE
*/sample1520 ONE OF THE SAVAGES OF THE MAINLAND WHO HAD WANDERED
*/sample1521 OUT TO THE SEA IN A SMALL BOAT LUCKILY I
*/sample1522 WAS NOT ON SHORE AT THAT TIME BUT WHAT IF
*/sample1523 HE HAD SEEN MY BOAT IF HE HAD SEEN THE
*/sample1524 BOAT HE WOULD HAVE REALISED THAT SOMEONE LIVED ON THE
*/sample1525 ISLAND AND WOULD SOON RETURN WIT OTHERS TO KILL AND
*/sample1526 EAT ME AND SO I LAY FEARFUL FOR MANY DAYS
*/sample1527 AND PRAYED FOR PROTECTION IN DOING SO I WAS MUCH
*/sample1528 COMFORTED AND I BEGAN TO GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE BUT
*/sample1529 EVEN NOW AS I WENT FORWARD I LOOKED BEHIND ME
*/sample1530 FREQUENTLY AS I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED HOWEVER AS I WENT
*/sample1531 ABOUT FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND SAW NOTHING I
*/sample1532 BECAME A LITTLE BOLDER I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO
*/sample1533 THE SHORE AGAIN AND EXAMINE THE FOOTPRINT ONCE MORE I
*/sample1534 DECIDED TO MEASURE IT WITH MY OWN FOOT MARK AS
*/sample1535 I CAME CLOSER TO THE FOOTPRINT I REALISED THAT IT
*/sample1536 COULD NOT BE MY FOOTPRINT BECAUSE I HAD NOT COME
*/sample1537 TO THIS PART OF THE BEACH SINCE A LONG TIME
*/sample1538 SECONDLY AS I PLACED MY FOOT ALONGSIDE THAT FOOTPRINT IT
*/sample1539 SEEMED LARGER THAN MY OWN MY FEAR RETURNED I
*/sample1540 WENT HOME AGAIN BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE THE
*/sample1541 ISLAND WAS INHABITED CRYING ONLY A LITTLE BIT IS NO
*/sample1542 USE YOU MUST CRY UNTIL YOUR PILLOW IS SOAKED THEN

*/sample1678 SHAPES AND COLOURS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PLAYING A GAME
*/sample1679 THERE FACES WERE SERIOUS AND THEY WERE SILENT THE ONLY
*/sample1680 SOUND WAS THE NOISE OF THE BALLS WHICH ECHOED IN

*/sample1682 THEM THEY STOPPED PLAYING AND STARED AT RIP WITH A
*/sample1683 FIXED GAZE RIP WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED HIS COMPANION EMPTIED THE
