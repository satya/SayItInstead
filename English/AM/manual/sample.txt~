SAMPLE1497 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS GOING TOWARDS MY BOAT I
SAMPLE1498 WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE FOOTPRINT OF A MAN ON
SAMPLE1499 THE SAND I STOOD AMAZED I LISTENED I LOOKED AROUND
SAMPLE1500 ME I COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR SEE ANYTHING I WENT
SAMPLE1501 UP HIGHER TO LOOK DOWN I WENT UP THE SHORE
SAMPLE1502 AND DOWN THE SHORE BUT IT WAS NO GOOD I
SAMPLE1503 COULD FIND NO OTHER FOOT PRINT BUT THAT ONE I
SAMPLE1504 WENT TO SEE IT AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE WERE
SAMPLE1505 ANY MORE FOOT PRINTS AND TO TELL IF IT WERE
SAMPLE1506 MY IMAGINATION BUT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN FOR THERE WAS
SAMPLE1507 EXACTLY THE PRINT OF A FOOT I COULD NOT IMAGINE
SAMPLE1508 HOW IT CAME THERE I STAYED A LONG TIME THINKING
SAMPLE1509 BUT BECAME MORE AND MORE CONFUSED AT LAST I RETURNED
SAMPLE1510 HOME VERY FRIGHTENED LOOKING BEHIND ME AFTER EVERY TWO OR
SAMPLE1511 THREE STEPS MISTAKING EVERY BUSH AND TREE TO BE A
SAMPLE1512 MAN WHEN I CAME TO MY CAVE WHICH I CALLED
SAMPLE1513 MY CASTLE I RAN INSIDE IT AS IF I WERE
SAMPLE1514 BEING CHASED I DO NOT REMEMBER WHETHER I USED THE
SAMPLE1515 LADDER OR WENT IN BY THE HOLE IN THE ROCK
SAMPLE1516 WHICH I CALLED THE DOOR I RAN FOR COVER FASTER
SAMPLE1517 THAN ANY ANIMAL COULD RUN I DID NOT SLEEP THAT
SAMPLE1518 NIGHT THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN
SAMPLE1519 THE MORE AFRAID I BECAME I THOUGHT IT COULD BE
SAMPLE1520 ONE OF THE SAVAGES OF THE MAINLAND WHO HAD WANDERED
SAMPLE1521 OUT TO THE SEA IN A SMALL BOAT LUCKILY I
SAMPLE1522 WAS NOT ON SHORE AT THAT TIME BUT WHAT IF
SAMPLE1523 HE HAD SEEN MY BOAT IF HE HAD SEEN THE
SAMPLE1524 BOAT HE WOULD HAVE REALISED THAT SOMEONE LIVED ON THE
SAMPLE1525 ISLAND AND WOULD SOON RETURN WIT OTHERS TO KILL AND
SAMPLE1526 EAT ME AND SO I LAY FEARFUL FOR MANY DAYS
SAMPLE1527 AND PRAYED FOR PROTECTION IN DOING SO I WAS MUCH
SAMPLE1528 COMFORTED AND I BEGAN TO GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE BUT
SAMPLE1529 EVEN NOW AS I WENT FORWARD I LOOKED BEHIND ME
SAMPLE1530 FREQUENTLY AS I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED HOWEVER AS I WENT
SAMPLE1531 ABOUT FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND SAW NOTHING I
SAMPLE1532 BECAME A LITTLE BOLDER I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO
SAMPLE1533 THE SHORE AGAIN AND EXAMINE THE FOOTPRINT ONCE MORE I
SAMPLE1534 DECIDED TO MEASURE IT WITH MY OWN FOOT MARK AS
SAMPLE1535 I CAME CLOSER TO THE FOOTPRINT I REALISED THAT IT
SAMPLE1536 COULD NOT BE MY FOOTPRINT BECAUSE I HAD NOT COME
SAMPLE1537 TO THIS PART OF THE BEACH SINCE A LONG TIME
SAMPLE1538 SECONDLY AS I PLACED MY FOOT ALONGSIDE THAT FOOTPRINT IT
SAMPLE1539 SEEMED LARGER THAN MY OWN MY FEAR RETURNED I
SAMPLE1540 WENT HOME AGAIN BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE THE
SAMPLE1541 ISLAND WAS INHABITED CRYING ONLY A LITTLE BIT IS NO
