"*/sample1468.lab"
CLIMBED
UP
THE
TREE
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
THE
CREEPER
.
"*/sample1469.lab"
HE
GOT
TO
THE
TOP
AND
SPREAD
HIS
NEST
THERE
.
"*/sample1470.lab"
THEN
HE
CLIMBED
DOWN
AND
WENT
AWAY
IN
THE
EVENING
.
"*/sample1471.lab"
THE
GEESE
RETURNED
HOME
THEY
DID
NOT
NOTICE
THE
NET
.
"*/sample1472.lab"
AS
THEY
FLEW
INTO
THE
TREE
THEY
WERE
TRAPPED
THEY
.
"*/sample1473.lab"
STRUGGLED
HARD
TO

OUT
BUT
THEY
COULD
NOT
HELP

"*/sample1476.lab"
SAID
THE
WISE
OLD
BIRD
LONG
AGO
I
HAD
TOLD
.
"*/sample1477.lab"
YOU
TO
DESTROY
THE
KEEPER
BUT
YOU
DID
NOT
NOW

"*/sample1478.lab"

WILL
COME
.
"*/sample1479.lab"
BACK
AND
KILL
US
ALL
WE

"*/sample1482.lab"
REPLIED
THE
WISE
BIRD
WHEN
THE
HUNTER
COMES
YOU
MUST
.
"*/sample1483.lab"
ALL
PRETEND
TO
BE
DEAD
JUST
LIE
STILL
THE
.
"*/sample1484.lab"
HUNTER
WILL
NOT
HARM
DEAD
BIRDS
HE
WILL
THROW
US
.
"*/sample1485.lab"
TO
THE
GROUND
IT
WILL
THEM
BE
EASY
FOR
HIM
.
"*/sample1486.lab"
TO
CLIMB
DOWN
COLLECT
THE
DEAD
BIRDS
AND
TAKE
THEM
.
"*/sample1487.lab"
HOME
WHEN
THE
LAST
OF
US
HAS
BEEN
THROWN
DOWN
.
"*/sample1488.lab"
WE
MUST
QUICKLY
GET
UP
AND
FLY
AWAY
IN
THE
.
"*/sample1489.lab"
MORNING
THE
HUNTER
CAME
TO
THE
TREE
AND
CLIMBED
UP
.
"*/sample1490.lab"
HE
LOOKED
AT
THE
GEESE
IN
THE
NET
THEY
ARE
.
"*/sample1491.lab"
ALL
DEAD
HE
MUTTERED
TO
HIMSELF
HE
THREW
THEM
OUT
.
"*/sample1492.lab"
OF
THE
NET
ONE
BY
ONE
THE
BIRDS
LAY
STILL
.
"*/sample1493.lab"
UNTIL
THE
LAST
ONE
HAD
BEEN
THROWN
OUT
THEN
ALL
.
"*/sample1494.lab"
AT
ONCE
THEY
GOT
UP
FLAPPED
THEIR
WINGS
AND
FLEW
.
"*/sample1495.lab"
AWAY
THE
HUNTER
WAS
TAKEN
BY
SURPRISE
FROM
THE
TOP
.
"*/sample1496.lab"
OF
THE
TREE
HE
WATCHED
ALL
THE
GEESE
FLY
AWAY
.
"*/sample1497.lab"
ONE
DAY
WHEN
I
WAS
GOING
TOWARDS
MY
BOAT
I
.
"*/sample1498.lab"
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
THE
FOOTPRINT
OF
A
MAN
ON
.
"*/sample1499.lab"
THE
SAND
I
STOOD
AMAZED
I
LISTENED
I
LOOKED
AROUND
.
"*/sample1500.lab"
ME
I
COULD
NEITHER
HEAR
NOR
SEE
ANYTHING
I
WENT
.
"*/sample1501.lab"
UP
HIGHER
TO
LOOK
DOWN
I
WENT
UP
THE
SHORE
.
"*/sample1502.lab"
AND
DOWN
THE
SHORE
BUT
IT
WAS
NO
GOOD
I
.
"*/sample1503.lab"
COULD
FIND
NO
OTHER
FOOT
PRINT
BUT
THAT
ONE
I
.
"*/sample1504.lab"
WENT
TO
SEE
IT
AGAIN
TO
SEE
IF
THERE
WERE
.
"*/sample1505.lab"
ANY
MORE
FOOT
PRINTS
AND
TO
TELL
IF
IT
WERE
.
"*/sample1506.lab"
MY
IMAGINATION
BUT
I
WAS
NOT
MISTAKEN
FOR
THERE
WAS
.
"*/sample1507.lab"
EXACTLY
THE
PRINT
OF
A
FOOT
I
COULD
NOT
IMAGINE
.
"*/sample1508.lab"
HOW
IT
CAME
THERE
I
STAYED
A
LONG
TIME
THINKING
.
"*/sample1509.lab"
BUT
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
CONFUSED
AT
LAST
I
RETURNED
.
"*/sample1510.lab"
HOME
VERY
FRIGHTENED
LOOKING
BEHIND
ME
AFTER
EVERY
TWO
OR
.
"*/sample1511.lab"
THREE
STEPS
MISTAKING
EVERY
BUSH
AND
TREE
TO
BE
A
.
"*/sample1512.lab"
MAN
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
MY
CAVE
WHICH
I
CALLED
.
"*/sample1513.lab"
MY
CASTLE
I
RAN
INSIDE
IT
AS
IF
I
WERE
.
"*/sample1514.lab"
BEING
CHASED
I
DO
NOT
REMEMBER
WHETHER
I
USED
THE
.
"*/sample1515.lab"
LADDER
OR
WENT
IN
BY
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
ROCK
.
"*/sample1516.lab"
WHICH
I
CALLED
THE
DOOR
I
RAN
FOR
COVER
FASTER
.
"*/sample1517.lab"
THAN
ANY
ANIMAL
COULD
RUN
I
DID
NOT
SLEEP
THAT
.
"*/sample1518.lab"
NIGHT
THE
MORE
I
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WHAT
I
HAD
SEEN
.
"*/sample1519.lab"
THE
MORE
AFRAID
I
BECAME
I
THOUGHT
IT
COULD
BE
.
"*/sample1520.lab"
ONE
OF
THE
SAVAGES
OF
THE
MAINLAND
WHO
HAD
WANDERED
.
"*/sample1521.lab"
OUT
TO
THE
SEA
IN
A
SMALL
BOAT
LUCKILY
I
.
"*/sample1522.lab"
WAS
NOT
ON
SHORE
AT
THAT
TIME
BUT
WHAT
IF
.
"*/sample1523.lab"
HE
HAD
SEEN
MY
BOAT
IF
HE
HAD
SEEN
THE
.
"*/sample1524.lab"
BOAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
REALISED
THAT
SOMEONE
LIVED
ON
THE
.
"*/sample1525.lab"
ISLAND
AND
WOULD
SOON
RETURN
WIT
OTHERS
TO
KILL
AND
.
"*/sample1526.lab"
EAT
ME
AND
SO
I
LAY
FEARFUL
FOR
MANY
DAYS
.
"*/sample1527.lab"
AND
PRAYED
FOR
PROTECTION
IN
DOING
SO
I
WAS
MUCH
.
"*/sample1528.lab"
COMFORTED
AND
I
BEGAN
TO
GO
OUT
TO
INVESTIGATE
BUT
.
"*/sample1529.lab"
EVEN
NOW
AS
I
WENT
FORWARD
I
LOOKED
BEHIND
ME
.
"*/sample1530.lab"
FREQUENTLY
AS
I
WAS
VERY
FRIGHTENED
HOWEVER
AS
I
WENT
.
"*/sample1531.lab"
ABOUT
FOR
TWO
OR
THREE
DAYS
AND
SAW
NOTHING
I
.
"*/sample1532.lab"
BECAME
A
LITTLE
BOLDER
I
DECIDED
TO
GO
DOWN
TO
.
"*/sample1533.lab"
THE
SHORE
AGAIN
AND
EXAMINE
THE
FOOTPRINT
ONCE
MORE
I
.
"*/sample1534.lab"
DECIDED
TO
MEASURE
IT
WITH
MY
OWN
FOOT
MARK
AS
.
"*/sample1535.lab"
I
CAME
CLOSER
TO
THE
FOOTPRINT
I
REALISED
THAT
IT
.
"*/sample1536.lab"
COULD
NOT
BE
MY
FOOTPRINT
BECAUSE
I
HAD
NOT
COME
.
"*/sample1537.lab"
TO
THIS
PART
OF
THE
BEACH
SINCE
A
LONG
TIME
.
"*/sample1538.lab"
SECONDLY
AS
I
PLACED
MY
FOOT
ALONGSIDE
THAT
FOOTPRINT
IT
.
"*/sample1539.lab"
SEEMED
LARGER
THAN
MY
OWN
MY
FEAR
RETURNED
I
.
"*/sample1540.lab"
WENT
HOME
AGAIN
BELIEVING
THAT
THERE
WAS
SOMEONE
THERE
THE
.
"*/sample1541.lab"
ISLAND
WAS
INHABITED
CRYING
ONLY
A
LITTLE
BIT
IS
NO
.
"*/sample1542.lab"
USE
YOU
MUST
CRY
UNTIL
YOUR
PILLOW
IS
SOAKED
THEN
.
"*/sample1543.lab"
YOU
CAN
JUMP
IN
THE
SHOWER
AND
SPLASH
SPLASH
SPLASH
.
"*/sample1544.lab"
THEN
YOU
CAN
THROW
OPEN
YOUR
WINDOW
HA
HA
HA
.
"*/sample1545.lab"
AND
IF
PEOPLE
SAY
HEY
WHAT'S
GOING
ON
UP
.
"*/sample1546.lab"
THERE
HA
HA
SING
BACK
HAPPINESS
WAS
HIDING
IN

"*/sample1547.lab"
LAST

.
"*/sample1550.lab"
CAN
YOU
SIT
WITH
A
BOOK
FOR

TOGETHER
THAT'S
.
"*/sample1551.lab"
BECAUSE
I
WANT
MY
FOUNDATION
IN
EDUCATION
TO
BE
VERY
.
"*/sample1552.lab"
STRONG
IF
THE
BASE
IS
STRONG
THEN
THE
BUILDING
WILL
.
"*/sample1553.lab"
STAND
FIRMLY
SOMETIMES
IT
TAKES
ME
TWO
YEARS
TO
DO

"*/sample1554.lab"
ONE

BHAIYA
YOU
ARE
FIVE
YEARS
OLDER
THAN

"*/sample1555.lab"
I
AM
AND
THREE
CLASSES
AHEAD
OF

I
WONDER
.
"*/sample1556.lab"
WHY

WRITING
THE
SAME
WORD
TWENTY
TIMES
ONE
.
"*/sample1557.lab"
SENTENCE
MORE
THAN
TWENTY
TIMES
AND

IN

"*/sample1562.lab"
YOU
RUN
INTO
THE

PLAY
MARBLES
AND
FLY

YOU
HAVE
MASTERED
THE

"*/sample1591.lab"
YOU
HAVE
TO

WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
STUDY
A
SUBJECT
LIKE

FIRST
TRY

FIND
OUT
WHAT
IS

AND
THEN
.
"*/sample1635.lab"
CALL

IT
.
"*/sample1816.lab"
SOUNDED
LIKE

ALL
SAT
.
"*/sample1826.lab"
